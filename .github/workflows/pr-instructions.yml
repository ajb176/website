  #Instructions for testing the Check-Team-Membership action:l
  #1) Delete the '#' on line 9 to uncomment the testing branch
  #2) Replace the token on line 51 with a user-generated token (Instructions will be linked in PR)
  #3) Change the owner assignment on lines 65 and 71 from 'hackforla' to your own github handle. Mine would be 'ajb176' 
  #4) For testing the success condition: Test the action excluding step #5
  #5) For testing the fail condition: Change the username assidgnment from 'prAuthor' in line 56 to a random string that doesn't accidentally spell out the handle of someone on the website-write team
